# Smart-Voice-Assistant
    This project is a simple Arabic voice assistant with a professional graphical interface using `Tkinter`.
    It allows you to speak using your microphone, then responds to you in Arabic voice using `gTTS` and `Cohere`

  # Features
    Voice recording using the microphone
    Speech-to-text using OpenAI Whisper
    Smart Arabic response using Cohere AI
    Text-to-speech in Arabic using gTTS
    GUI with live chat display



  # Steps :
	1.Created a virtual environment using Anaconda
	2.Installed the required libraries
	3.Built a chat.py script with a GUI using Tkinter
	4.The app records voice input, transcribes it using Whisper, sends it to Cohere for a response, then speaks the reply in Arabic using gTTS


# Used Libraries:
`tkinter `for the graphical interface

`threading ` to avoid freezing the GUI

`sounddevice `to record audio

`scipy ` to save audio in WAV format

`whisper ` to convert speech to text

`cohere ` to generate a smart reply

`gTTS `to convert text to Arabic speech

`pygame `to play the response audio

`io `to manage audio in memory without saving files
